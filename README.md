# TYPO3 Extension: Nagios Extensionlist

This [TYPO3](https://typo3.org) extension generates a list of insecure extensions for [EXT:nagios](https://github.com/schams-net/nagios).

## Description

[Nagios](https://nagios.org) is the industry standard in open-source server/service/network monitoring.
This extension can be installed in any (compatible) TYPO3 instance to generate a list of TYPO3 extensions,
which have been marked as *insecure* by the TYPO3 Security Team. The extension list is based on the
list at the [TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER)](https://extensions.typo3.org), which can be downloaded
as a scheduler task in TYPO3.

The format of the list generated by this extension can be used by the `check_typo3.sh` script, to check
for insecure TYPO3 instances. See https://schams.net/nagios for further details.
